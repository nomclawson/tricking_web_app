# Overview

This was my first project creating a web app. I have never done anything other make requests from an API that is related to web development so this was a good learning opportunity. I also was aware that this was new to me and adjusted my expectations so that in the case of difficulty I could adjust my expectations to simply display data. This leaves lots of room for future progress on this project which acted as an brief introduction into web applications and web development.

# Web Pages

My main page lists tricks requested from an API. Each trick is a link to a new page which displays the description of that trick. Currently I am trying to debug the duplication that occurs on the main trick list page.

# Development Environment

This app uses Django and Requests from Python and was developed using Visual Studio Code.
